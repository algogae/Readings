# Delayed Impact of Fair Machine Learning

## Abstract
Fairness in ML has been studied in static classification settings without concern of varying decision changes the underlying population over time. General belief on fairness criteria promote the well-being of the groups we aim to protect. There are bunch of known and studied fairness criteria, however by focusing on three criteria including unconstrained one, the belief can in fact frustrating. By completely characterizing the delayed impact of three standard criteria, we qualitatively explain the difference among them especially even in one-step feedback model.
